        For all tests: the p-value does not quantify evidence for the null 
        hypothesis versus the alternative hypothesis; the p-value also cannot be 
        taken to mean that the null hypothesis is either likely or unlikely to 
        hold, or that the data are more or less likely to occur under the null 
        hypothesis than under the alternative hypothesis. In order to obtain this 
        information a Bayesian analysis would be needed. <br> %7$s <br>%8$s <br>%9$s
