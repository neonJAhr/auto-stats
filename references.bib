We then attempt to analyze why, in spite of this faulty reasoning, the use of significance tests persists. We identify the illusion of probabilistic proof by contradiction as a central stumbling block, because it is based on a misleading generalization of reasoning from logic to inference under uncertainty. We present new data from a student sample and examples from the psychological literature showing the strength and prevalence of this illusion. We identify some intrinsic cognitive mechanisms (similarity to modus tollens reasoning; verbal ambiguity in describing the meaning of significance tests; and the need to rule out chance findings) and extrinsic social pressures which help to maintain the illusion. We conclude by mentioning some alternative methods for presenting and analyzing psychological data, none of which can be considered the ultimate method.},

Despite this supremacy however, numerous problems exist with NHST as a means of interpreting and understanding data. These problems have been articulated by various observers over the years, but are being taken seriously by researchers only slowly, if at all, as evidenced by the continuing emphasis on NHST in statistics classes, statistics textbooks, editorial policies and, of course, the day-to-day practices reported in empirical articles themselves ( Cumming et al., 2007 ). Over the past several decades, observers have suggested a simpler approach \textendash{} plotting the data with appropriate confidence intervals (CIs) around relevant sample statistics \textendash{} to supplement or take the place of hypothesis testing.

Apart from theoretical critiques on their appropriateness for evaluating scientific hypotheses, significance tests also receive criticism for inviting misinterpretations. We presented six common misinterpretations to psychologists who work in German universities and found out that they are still surprisingly widespread \textendash{} even among instructors who teach statistics to psychology students. Although these misinterpretations are well documented among students, until now there has been little research on pedagogical methods to remove them. Rather, they are considered ``hard facts'' that are impervious to correction. We discuss the roots of these misinterpretations and propose a pedagogical concept to teach significance tests, which involves explaining the meaning of statistical significance in an appropriate way.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Misunderstanding of significance tests and P values is widespread in clinical research and elsewhere. PURPOSE: To assess the implications of two common mistakes in the interpretation of statistical significance tests. The first one is the misinterpretation of the type I error rate as the expected proportion of false-positive results among all those called significant, also known as the false-positive report probability (FPRP). The second is the misinterpretation of a P value as (posterior) probability of the null hypothesis. METHODS: A reverse-Bayes approach is used to calculate a lower bound on the proportion of truly effective treatments that would ensure the FPRP to be equal or below the type I error rate. A reverse-Bayes approach using minimum Bayes factors (BFs) yields upper bounds on the prior probability of the null hypothesis that would justify the interpretation of the P value as the posterior probability of the null hypothesis. RESULTS: In a typical clinical trials setting, more than 50\% of the treatments need to be truly effective to justify equality of the type I error rate and the FPRP. To interpret the P value as posterior probability, the difference between the corresponding prior probability and the P value cannot exceed 12.4 percentage points. LIMITATIONS: The first analysis requires that the (one-sided) type I error rate is smaller than the type II error rate. The second result is valid under different scenarios describing how to transform P values to minimum BFs. CONCLUSIONS: The two misinterpretations imply strong and often unrealistic assumptions on the prior proportion or probability of truly effective treatments.},

In contrast to the hypothesis of Altshtein-Vogt dealing mainly with the problem of oncogene origin, the general theory of oncogenesis not only defines concretely the origin of the oncogene and the essence of its product, but also makes it possible to understand why, when and how integration of the oncogene with the genome of the cell leads to the transformation of the cell into a benign cell and when into a malignant tumour cell. An analysis of the essence of the "oncogene position effect" from this standpoint shows that an integration, similar in its mechanism but differing in polarity, of the genome of other viruses with the cell genome should lead to the formation of a corresponding antiviral stable (life-long) immunity or also to the emergence of pseudoautoimmune disease of the type caused by "slow" viruses.},

One of the proposed alternatives to NHST is using Bayes factors instead of p values. Here we denote the method of using Bayes factors to test point null models as "null hypothesis Bayesian testing" (NHBT). In this article we offer a wide overview of potential issues (limitations or sources of misinterpretation) with NHBT which is currently missing in the literature. We illustrate many of the shortcomings of NHBT by means of reproducible examples. The article concludes with a discussion of NHBT in particular and testing in general. In particular, we argue that posterior model probabilities should be given more emphasis than Bayes factors, because only the former provide direct answers to the most common research questions under consideration.

  abstract = {Tendeiro and Kiers (2019) provide a detailed and scholarly critique of Null Hypothesis Bayesian Testing (NHBT) and its central component-the Bayes factor-that allows researchers to update knowledge and quantify statistical evidence. Tendeiro and Kiers conclude that NHBT constitutes an improvement over frequentist p-values, but primarily elaborate on a list of 11 "issues" of NHBT. We believe that several issues identified by Tendeiro and Kiers are of central importance for elucidating the complementary roles of hypothesis testing versus parameter estimation and for appreciating the virtue of statistical thinking over conducting statistical rituals. But although we agree with many of their thoughtful recommendations, we believe that Tendeiro and Kiers are overly pessimistic, and that several of their "issues" with NHBT may in fact be conceived as pronounced advantages. We illustrate our arguments with simple, concrete examples and end with a critical discussion of one of the recommendations by Tendeiro and Kiers, which is that "estimation of the full posterior distribution offers a more complete picture" than a Bayes factor hypothesis test.
